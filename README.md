Learning the ropes (again)

I first of all offer my respectful obeisances unto my spiritual master Om Visnupad Sri Srimad BhaktiVedanta Madhava Goswami Maharaj.
It is only by his grace and that I will understand anything about web development. I can do absolutely nothing on my own. But if Gurudev and Krsna allow, I can humbly offer whatever meager services I can in love and affection to Sri Sri Radha and Krsna.
